# Stage2_Hackbio
Replicating Identification of somatic and germline variants from tumor and normal sample pairs workflow

## Create directory name Stage2
### Create a folder under Stage2 named datasets to download all dataset for this process

## Download all data needed
The data from Zenodo using wget command line 

```
wget https://zenodo.org/record/2582555/files/SLGFSK-N_231335_r1_chr5_12_17.fastq.gz
```
This command line is used to download all four data and reference genome. 

## Quality Control
FastQC was used to perform quality control on both normal and tumor tissue to make sure that the input data is of good quality, i.e., that there havenâ€™t been any major issues during DNA preparation, exon capture, or during actual sequencing.

```
fastqc datasets/SLGFSK-N_231335_r1_chr5_12_17.fastq.gz datasets/SLGFSK-N_231335_r2_chr5_12_17.fastq.gz
```

## Mapping reads to the human reference genome
