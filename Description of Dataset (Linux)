The datasets used in this analysis were gotten from a real-world data from a cancer patientâ€™s tumor and normal tissue samples. 
The datasets only includes reads from human chromosomes 5, 12 and 17.
The tumor tissue and human genome couldn't be used only to identify somatic and germline variant in tumor cells. 
This is because healthy tissue contains many thousands of variants compared to the reference genome and every individual inherits a unique pattern of many variants from their parents. 

Four data/sequences were used in this analysis. Two were from normal tissue and the other were from  tumor tissue. The data are in pairs of forward and reverse reads sequence.
The datasets were downloaded from Zenodo using the wget command and the link to the data. 
For example, for the forward read sequence for the normal tissue, the command used to download the data to the linux environment is: 
```
wget https://zenodo.org/record/2582555/files/SLGFSK-N_231335_r1_chr5_12_17.fastq.gz
```
